Banked Stack Pointer

==============================
1. Cortex M processor physically has 3 Stack pointers
SP(R13),MSP and PSP
MSP : Main stack pointer
PSP :Process stack pointer

SP is Called as Current stack pointer.

2.After processor reset, By default , MSP will be 
selected as current stack pointer.That means, SP copies the contents of MSP.

3.Thread mode can change the current stack pointer to PSP bt configuring the
CONTROL register SPSEL bit.

4.Handler mode Will always use MSP as the current stack pointer.
That means ,configuring the CONTROL register SPSEL bit being in the handler
mode does not make sence.The write will be ignored.

5.MSP will be intialised auomatically by the processor after reset
by reading the content of the address 0x0000_0000.

6.If you want to use the PSP then make sure that you initialize the 
PSP to valid stack adress in your cade.
